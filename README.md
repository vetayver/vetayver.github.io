## Her Education

*Edgar Allan Poe's story "The Tell-Tale Heart" is famous for its dark and straightforward theme. It is about an unknown narrator who kills an elderly man because of his peculiar eye. The said narrator is haunted by the man's heartbeat for the rest of his life.* 

A quick summary of the story:
    *I was like a cat on coals, waiting for my moment to strike, unable to control my urge to end the life of the elderly gentleman who resided with me. He was not hostile nor did he scream at me but his eye. Oh, his peculiar eye bothered me to no end! Every time I saw it, I felt a sense of deep discomfort that I couldn't shake and I knew that I needed to do something about it. The only thing I could do to put an end to this was murder. For seven nights, I had sneaked into his room. I was like a hawk waiting for the perfect time to catch its prey. I couldnâ€™t see his eye while he was asleep so I spared him. On the 8th night, I almost got caught. I was quivering and then the old man let out a frightened moan and I knew that I had to act fast. I lit my lantern, shining it right into his blue eye. The sound of his heartbeat echoed through the room, almost as if it were mocking me. I knew what I was about to do was wrong, but I felt compelled to do it anyway. Others would do the same, right? I was afraid that the neighbors might hear his racing heartbeat, so I lashed out with all of my strength. At that moment, my feelings of anxiety and paranoia won out over my logical mind. I felt a strange sense of euphoria as I hacked the old man into pieces*

*This is Edgar Allan Poe's easiest story as it is straightforward and symbolisms are few. The Cask of Amontillado is about a man (Montressor) who's tired of being a laughingstock of a wealthy man (Fortunato) Montressor killed Fortunato and he started this by playing with his ego*
